/**
 * The `CompressionStrategy` interface defines the contract for classes that implement various compression
 * and decompression algorithms. Classes implementing this interface should provide methods to encode (compress)
 * and decode (decompress) data, typically represented as byte arrays.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface can be used to compress and decompress data in a consistent manner,
 * allowing for flexibility in choosing different compression algorithms while maintaining a common interface.
 * This is particularly useful when dealing with various data storage or transmission scenarios where different
 * compression techniques may be more suitable.
