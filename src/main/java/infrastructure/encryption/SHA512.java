/**
 * The {@code SHA512} class implements the {@link EncryptionStrategy} interface
 * to provide a mechanism for hashing data using the SHA-512 algorithm.
 *
 * <p>As SHA-512 is a one-way hash function, the {@link #decrypt(byte[])} method is
 * not supported and will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} if called.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is intended for use cases where data integrity verification or
 * secure fingerprinting is required rather than reversible encryption.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * EncryptionStrategy sha512Strategy = new SHA512();
 * byte[] hashedData = sha512Strategy.encrypt(plainTextData);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The above example shows how to use the {@code SHA512} class to hash data.
 * Since hashing is a one-way operation, the {@code decrypt} method is not applicable.</p>
