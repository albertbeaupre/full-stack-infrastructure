/**
 * A utility class for reading and writing various data types to a byte buffer with support for bit-level operations.
 * <p>
 * The {@code DynamicByteBuffer} class provides methods to serialize and deserialize primitive data types (byte, char, short,
 * int, long, float, double, boolean), strings (UTF-8 encoded with a length prefix), and individual bits to/from a byte array.
 * It maintains separate read and write positions, allowing sequential access to the buffer. The buffer supports configurable
 * byte order (big-endian or little-endian) for multibyte types, with big-endian as the default.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key features include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Support for reading and writing primitive types with bounds checking.</li>
 *     <li>UTF-8 string handling with an integer length prefix.</li>
 *     <li>Bit-level operations for compact data encoding.</li>
 *     <li>Bulk byte array operations for efficient data transfer.</li>
 *     <li>Dynamic resizing of the buffer when write operations exceed capacity.</li>
 *     <li>Utility methods for position management, slicing, and buffer reset.</li>
 *     <li>Configurable byte order (big-endian or little-endian) for multi-byte types.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b> This class is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a {@code DynamicByteBuffer} instance
 * concurrently, external synchronization is required to prevent data corruption or inconsistent state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage Example:</b>
 * <pre>
 * byte[] buffer = new byte[100];
 * DynamicByteBuffer dbb = new DynamicByteBuffer(buffer);
 * dbb.setByteOrder(DynamicByteBuffer.ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN)
 *    .writeInt(12345)
 *    .writeString("Hello")
 *    .writeBit(true)
 *    .flushBits();
 * dbb.setReadPosition(0);
 * System.out.println(dbb.readInt());    // Outputs: 12345
 * System.out.println(dbb.readString()); // Outputs: Hello
 * System.out.println(dbb.readBit());    // Outputs: true
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> When performing bit-level operations, ensure to call {@link #flushBits()} after writing bits to ensure all
 * buffered bits are written to the underlying byte array. Reading or writing bits after changing the read or write position
 * resets the bit buffers to maintain consistency. The byte order affects only multi-byte types (char, short, int, long,
 * float, double, string length prefix); single-byte and bit operations are unaffected.
 * </p>
